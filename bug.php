This code attempts to access an array element using a non-integer key. In PHP, array keys are typically integers, and using strings as keys can lead to unexpected behavior or errors. If the intention was to use an associative array, the code needs to be corrected to handle string keys appropriately.  Additionally, the isset() check is not sufficient to prevent a notice if the key is not set and empty; it will still produce a notice.
