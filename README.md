This repository demonstrates a common PHP error: "Undefined index".  The `bug.php` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.php` provides a corrected version.  The error arises from attempting to access an array element using a string key when the key might not exist, and also from not correctly checking for an empty key value.  The solution shows how to use `isset()` to check for the key before accessing it and demonstrates using an associative array with string keys for better clarity and to resolve the "Undefined index" issue.  The example highlights the importance of properly handling array keys and checking for their existence to prevent unexpected behavior and errors.
